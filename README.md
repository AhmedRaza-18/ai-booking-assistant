## **🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS FOR UPWORK**

### **Client Perspective:**

When you deliver code to a client:

**BAD:** One messy file
```
client_project.py  (2000 lines, no comments)
```
Client thinks: "This looks unprofessional. Hard to maintain."

**GOOD:** Organized structure
```
ai-booking-assistant/
├── app/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── routes/
```
Client thinks: "This developer knows what they're doing. Worth the money."

### **Upwork Portfolio:**

You can show this structure in your proposal:
```
"I follow industry-standard project structure:
- Modular code (easy to maintain)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Professional organization
- Easy to add features later"
